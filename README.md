# Sales-Data-Exploration-Regional-Product-and-Customer-Segment-Analysis-Using-Tableau
Today's business decisions are increasingly data-driven, and this report leverages Tableau's data visualization capabilities to explore sales performance across geographic regions, product lines, and customer segments, addressing key research questions on regional sales performance, highest-earning product lines, and the relationship between deal sizes and revenue. The analysis, based on data from Kaggle, revealed that the United States and Spain topped regional sales, with Classic Cars and Vintage Cars generating the highest revenue among product lines. Interestingly, there was a relatively low correlation between deal size and sales, with Medium-sized deals constituting the highest revenue. The report concludes that focusing on top-performing regions, profitable product lines, and tailored marketing strategies for customer segments can help upscale earnings and maintain a competitive edge through continuous monitoring and analysis of sales data.
